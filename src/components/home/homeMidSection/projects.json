As Germany’s largest health study, the overarching aim of the National Cohort is to inform more effective disease prevention strategies, with a focus on seven major disease groups: cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular, neurologic and psychiatric, infectious, respiratory and musculoskeletal diseases. It will provide a major, central resource for population-based epidemiology in Germany, and will help to identify new and tailored strategies for early detection, prediction, and primary prevention of major diseases.",
